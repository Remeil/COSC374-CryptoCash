The rest of the files are used by the driver program and are not intended to be run on their own.

When the Driver program is run, the user is presented with a menu of options. To simulate a transaction, run through the options in ascending order. Undefined behavior may result when running in any other order. When simulating a transaction, the program will prompt for information that it needs. Each step of the process can be verified by looking at the files created in the subfolders.
